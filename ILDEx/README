This Geant4 example is based on the N03 Example which comes with Geant4

The Geometry represents a simplfied structure for the ILD central tracking detectors, VXD, SIT and TPC.

This example should function as a test for DD4hep and should be adapted as needed. 

The build setup is performed via CMake, i.e. :

cmake -DGeant4_DIR=[PATH_TO_GEANT4] -GXcode .. 

And has been tested against the beta release of Geant4 geant4.9.5.b01

Currently no sensitive detectors are implemented only the material.
